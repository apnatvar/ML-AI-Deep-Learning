Hello there!

There are codes from the book Practical Deep Learning - https://www.practicaldeeplearning.ai/
The codes are divided chapter wise. 

I am aware that the authors have been kind enough to provide us with all the code mentioned in the book.
As i work through it, I have realised some of the code is actually missing/deprecated.
Also, the provided code is available in the format for Jupyter Notebooks.
This is very convienient for learning to code with tthe book. You can go through it way faster than I have.

I prefer working on my own environment and working with scripts. This provides me a more hand-son experience. There are obviously
way more errors, and issues that I had to spend hours fixing. I was finally able to work out and I have the codes available 
in the form of Python Scripts that you can download and use directly. The only issue that might arise is that you do not have the 
relevant modules downloaded or updated to the same version as I used them. You might also need to install the relevant datasets from various 
websites as is recommened in the book. 

If you want more info please feel free to reach out on my email arawat@tcd.ie or find the LinkedIn link in my main repository. 

Hopefully these codes help you out and you can save valuable time while you learn.
