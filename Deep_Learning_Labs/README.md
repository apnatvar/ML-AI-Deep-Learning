### Semester 7 Coursework
I took this module as part of my coursework towards a BAI - Computer Engineering. It focusses on helping students build an understanding of Supervised and Unsupervised learning techniques ranging from Random Forest, SVMs to Deep, Convulated and Recurrent Neural Networks. It also informs the students on more complex neural architecures like Autoencoders, Attention Mechanisms, LSTMs, and GANs.

### Labs
These labs were completed as part of the coursework. A git routine and template for each lab for provided. Students had to build, train, and validate their own models. These were then pushed to a school server for evaluation. 

#### 1-3
Focus on building a foundational understanding of various metrics, accuracy, ROC Curves, training, validation, and test set splits using popular datasets like MINST using scikit-learn

#### 4-5
Focus on image recognition. Lab 4 works on building a model using only dense layers. Lab 5 offers convulation layers showing how a smaller simpler model with some convulation layers followed by dense layers is better than a model with only fully conulated layers.

#### 6
Also focusses on image recognition but now with transfer learning. Re-use the model from Lab 5 to develop this going forward. 

#### 7
Train an autonomous car to drive 5 lap on a circuit. Uses image recognition, convulation, and fully connected layers with Udacity's simulator for evaluation.
